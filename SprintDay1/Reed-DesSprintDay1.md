## User List:

**Dave** is a senior obtaining a degree in data science. While he prides himself in his knowledge of class topics, 
Dave has a difficult time working in groups. He finds that it is hard for him to express his ideas to his
group-mates, and his groups usually suffer because of this. Being shy ever since he could remember, the worst
part for him was always getting to know his teammates and develop a strategy on how he and his team would
communicate throughout their task together. He sometimes begins to feel shame, because his teammates ten
to view him as lazy and as though he does not have good ideas.

**Sara** is a junior in college pursuing a career in Software Engineering. She loves spending time on
campus and studying in the library. She values quiet time and listening to music by herself. Ever since
she can remember, school group projects have stressed her out, as she is always weary of sharing her
potential grade with other people she has never met. She worries that her group will not put in the same 
effort as her and it will be difficult for her to communicate with strangers.
