Persona: Bob Hawke, age 24, is senior at the University of Texas majoring in criminal justice. He hopes to transfer to a law school after graduating. He likes to spend his free time reading case law and he also spends time after school at a debate club. He often has a ton of paperwork to do in the form of reports, notes, annotations, and readings.

Scenarios: 

1. Bob is reading through a new case for his collaborative capstone project. He opens HiveMind and starts a new note on the shared page, summarizing key case facts, rulings, and precedent (I've been binging Suits on Netflix lol). Bob tags two classmates and organizes the notes into a timeline so that everyone will be aware of their tasks and due dates.

2. Bob is now the captain of the debate team. The team is debating the results of Roe v. Wade. He opens a timeline his teammates started on HiveMind and sees that each debate point is laid out across a schedule leading up to the debate. Bob claims a few points related to the historical context of the legal framework to assign himself the task of gathering research.
